**Dear Learner,**

We are delighted to welcome you to our 200 series on Object-Oriented Programming in C#.

Your journey thus far has been impressive, learning the fundamentals of C#, understanding variables, flow control, and arrays, and demonstrating a keenness to acquire more advanced skills. As we move forward, we realize that the concepts we'll tackle are challenging. Class fundamentals, inheritance, interfaces, unit testing, and dependency injection aren't lightweight topics by any means, and they often discourage learners to the point where they give up.

***But we want you to remember that you are not alone.\***

With a decade of teaching this topic, we have trained countless beginners like you. We assure you that you are in good hands. This course is crafted like those we've designed for universities, coding bootcamps, and Fortune 500 clients. It's a proven learning path that we are excited to offer directly to consumers like you for the first time.

What sets this course apart is not just its content but its approach. Here are three key features that will give you a unique learning experience:
