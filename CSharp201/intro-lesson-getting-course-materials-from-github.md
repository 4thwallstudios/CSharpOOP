Click the Code button and choose the "Open with GitHub Desktop" option.

A pop-up should come up asking if you want to 'Open GitHubDesktop.exe'. Go ahead and let it open the app. Then, simply follow the prompts on GitHub Desktop to clone the repository into a local folder on your computer.

To clone the repository directly from the GitHub Desktop application, go to the File -> Clone Repository command. Then choose the URL tab and enter this URL:

https://github.com/SkillFoundryIO/CSharp200

Choose the local folder where you would like to store your code.

Once the repository is cloned, you can use the Pull command from the Repository in the application menu to refresh the materials if there are changes.

## Conclusion

With this, you are finished! You can navigate to the repository on your local machine and the projects and solutions provided with this course!
